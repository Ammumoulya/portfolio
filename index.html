                        </h3>
                        <p>I was eager to start an internship during my fourth semester so that I could put my knowledge and experience to work in order to help me learn more, grow, and finish everything that is planned for me.<br><br>
                        Use LinkedIn as a resource to learn about internship possibilities. <br><br>
                        I received a link to a Bharat Intern internship on LinkedIn. <br><br>
                        I did some research before applying right away for the internship in web development.<br><br>

                            The main goals of Bharat Intern are to provide chances for leadership growth, academic achievement, and student involvement in common interests.<br><br>
                            A different set of objectives and levels make up each level. <br><br>
                            Through this internship, we were given challenging opportunities and real-world projects. <br><br>
                            Overall, it was a wonderful educational opportunity. <br><br>
                            I get to work on various projects.</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>I participated in my first ever Hackathon organised by  Hence Technologies, Upskiller and Mate in collaboration with our college and other colleges <br><br>
                            It was a 48-hour Hackaton with students of varying skill sets competing from all over the continent for a share in a $1500 prize.<br><br>
                             My goodness, was I nervous in the beginning, 40 registered teams were working on creating a solution<br><br>
                             that would “increase social connection amongst Indian Youth”</p>
